# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Disaster Response Platform (DaRP)

**Date:** 24.10.2023

## Progress Summary

This week we started the implementation phase of our project.

On the Backend, we've successfully implemented basic CRUD operations for both profiles & users and needs & resources. Additionally, the authentication system, inclusive of session tokens, is up and running.

On the Frontend, while the profile implementation is partially completed, we've made headway with the design of a simple map page, put together a draft for the filter menu, and brought the main page and authentication system to life.

As for Mobile developments, the local database has been implemented, and the 'Need' table, complete with its functionalities, has been set up. Furthermore, users can now view a basic navigation bar, a simple main page, and a dummy profile page. The sign-in and login functions have templates, even addressing scenarios like password mismatches. Moreover, the UI for adding needs has been set in place.

### Objectives for the following week

With only one week left until the Customer Milestone 1 deliverables are due, our focus for the upcoming week will be:

- **Preparation for Milestone**: Making sure the application satisfies what we set out to do for Customer Milestone 1.
- **Backend Objectives**: We will improve and add new functionalities to our services, conduct unit tests regarding our endpoints, and refine the database models.
- **Frontend & Mobile Sync**: The application should be consistent between the front-end and mobile interfaces
- **User scenario implementation**: Preparing a presentation with a plausible user scenario
- **Add resource create-save-edit design implementation**: Preparing frontend form element for a used to add resource
- **Deliverables**: Preparing the deliverables required in the course.

In summary, the next week is about getting prepared to the Milestone 1 as complete as we can, including the basic functionalities of our platform and preparing Deliverables.

## Risks

- Unit tests and integration with UI may uncover bugs for the backend code we produced and tested already
- Unforeseen difficulties may arise for Activity visualization on map (as this is a rather new area for us)
- Possible earthquake in Istanbul before we complete the project. (that is why we work hard)
- World War III
