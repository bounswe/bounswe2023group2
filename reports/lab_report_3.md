# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Disaster Response Platform (DaRP)

**Date:** 17.10.2023

## Progress Summary

The group is content of the kick start. The project plan (which will be reviewed as planned in the plan but will also be subject to continuous scrutiny) has been prepared with contributions by the sub teams and will be a very useful map for our following efforts.

Another important development of the week is about the actual work of subteams. Backend, frontend and mobile teams made a quick (and [meticulous](https://www.google.com/search?q=meticulous+meaning) as well) start in developing the code with backbone/design issues.

The team may seem to be slow in self training issues which is not a risk for the time being. This issue should rather be seen as a result of a much optimistic approach of the previous team meeting. This optimism was not beyond limits, so sometimes it is better to be too optimistic.

### Objectives for the following week

With only 2 weeks left until the Customer Milestone 1 deliverables are due, our focus for the upcoming week will be:

- **Preparation**: We want to have a few key functions up and running so we can test them out and make sure they're working as expected.
- **Platform Foundation**: Our aim is to have the initial parts of our platform ready by the end of next week.
- **Backend Progress**: A core backend function will be completed. This will act as a sample to guide further developments.
- **Frontend & Mobile Sync**: As soon as the backend function is finalized, our frontend and mobile teams will integrate and adapt it for user interaction.

In summary, the next week is about setting up the foundational elements of our platform and ensuring we're on track for upcoming milestone.

## Planned vs. Actual

- We faced challenges with EC2 and AWS configurations, causing a delay in preparing the Wiki document for the CI/CD operation. We are working on resolving these issues.
- Teams had a quicker start on coding than presumed.
- A new team member was added to the Frontend team, leading to some adjustments in the project plan.
- We were informed that we will not be able to arrange a utility mailbox with a boun.edu.tr extension for our project.
- Simultaneous development led to some conflicts in the main branch on the merging stage.

## Risks

- We may not have enough knowledge to develop using some technologies, as our own training for those technologies and development happen at the same time.
- We might encounter problems with hashing and sessions in Authentication
- Working together on github as a large and novice group, we might have some merge conflicts
- Possible earthquake in Istanbul before we complete the project. (that is why we work hard)
