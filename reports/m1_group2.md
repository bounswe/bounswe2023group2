## Milestone Review

**A summary of the project status and any changes that are planned for moving forward**:
The project is divided into 3 milestones at the beginning of the semester. Milestone 1st contains learning, research and architecture desicions which makes difficult to asses time needed for the tasks. As a team we successed to build a code layout that makes contributions easier and reached our milestone 1st goals. At the beginning of the semester, difficulties on the firebase notifications has been discussed in terms of deployment issues and implementation issues, So the spesifications about the notifications are delayed to the last milestone.

**A summary of the customer feedback and reflections**:
The customer stated the alignment with the project and their expectations.

Our color choices in the UI for the mobile part of the project were criticized. It was said that recycler-view items did not look properly due to color preferences. We will go to be more simple and understandable in color selection. We will aim to have a common UI design with front-end until the next milestone.

### Evaluation of the milestone customer demo and the deliverables prepared (Impacts on the project plan - future reflections)

#### Design issues

The group started work reviewing the documents which were prepared last season. Requirements needed little change, more about articulation and conceptual consistency.
Diagrams were updated according to the retouch on the requirements document.
Information on these reside on the [Meeting Notes of Lab Meetings](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/tree/main/reports).

After these first initiatives, new issues arouse.

1. Some scenarios about needs and resources were brought up by the instructor. The group has the opinion that these are (or will easily be) covered by the current design.
2. The customer reviews of another group (Group 1), who are also working on the same definition are also noted by the group.
3. Requirements involved implementations of annotations paradigm but these were ambigous. The group is aware that some refinements on this issue is needed but the main path will not be affected.

The group thinks that precedings of CM-1 supports the current approach.

#### About the project plan

The Customer Milestone 1, the customer impressions and reviews were satisfactory. The group is satisfied as the work in CM 1 also proved the future success of the collective work.

#### About the contributions

The Milestone goals are successfully achieved. This was the result of the efficient collective work in the subgroups.
Still, the coordination of the subgroups should be improved, although no problems of lack of coordination occuredb

- Backend subgroup: Necessary API functions coded and implemented. So that frontend and mobile subgroup could make use of.

- Front-end subgroup: Coding, implementation and scenario use were successfully done for Milestone 1.

- Mobile subgroup: Mobile application included the implementation of offline use via a local database and related functions. Milestone 1 was also a proof study for this implementation.

Backend function calls successfully implemented on both Mobile and web front-end

### Evaluation of tools and processes used to manage the team project

- #### Communication

One of the first steps of the group was to define a [Communication Plan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/wiki/Communication-Plan) document. Use of meetings, communication tools etc. were briefly described. The group stuck to the decisions made and continued collective work accordingly.

- ##### Lab Meetings

The most important tool/platform to resolve the issues about the project (as said in the Communication Plan document) The group discussed about some design and workflow details and made the necessary assignments.

- ##### Github Issues

Using issues to define, describe and discuss work to be done (and being done) helped much to the coordination needs. At this phase, issues about coding, debugging or interfacing of various parts were very efficient.

- ##### Discord vs Whatsapp

The Communication Plan stated that:

> (using) WhatsApp for development and project requirements-related discussions (is not encouraged). Since it is not helpful in documenting, Important announcements and decisions can be missed.

But the group and the subteams made use of Whatsapp more than expected. On the other hand that does not imply a breach of the rule as the instant messages were mostly about the details of the current coding study.

The group used channels in Discord for different subteams. Those channels were made available to all members of the group.

- ##### Good documentation

The documents about the ongoing efforts are of crucial importance for coordinating the team work.

Specifically meeting notes (about the lab meetings), Project Plan and rules/convention documents helped implementing/fulfilling the plans.

  - We did not have big conflicts with the reviews, I asked small changes mostly.
    With Pull Request [357](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/pull/357), we encountered a conflict in the session implementation. Initially, it was stateful, but after thorough discussion, I recommended transitioning to a stateless approach using Json Web Tokens, and the implementation was subsequently updated to align with this recommendation([Backend - User session implementation](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/issues/367)).

#### Member : Mehmet Kuzulugil

##### Responsibilities:

As a member of the **_Backend Subteam_** my responsibilities focused on coding the business logic and documenting as well. This also brought issues about coding standards.
Backend Subteam did a collective work for researching on these issues. I contributed to this work and also benefited from the results of the study.

##### Main contributions:

- Code-related:

  - Did the coding for the backend implementation of User Profile related data entry. (CRUD for User Profile Information)
  - Prepared a first draft Authorization Scheme which was later surpassed by a final scheme (which was researched and coded by Begüm Arslan). The first draft had a design which stored user session tokens in the database and/but JWT approach was preferrable.
  - Adapted and used the decoration style explored by Begüm Arslan for documenting API functions.
  - Issues related to my coding work or the work I participated:

#### Member: Cahid Enes Keleş

##### Responsibilities:

I was mainly responsible for the profile page and log in - sign in - forgot password pages.

##### Main contributions:

I implemented the UIs of the log-in, sign-in and forgot password pages. I also implemented the UI of the profile page, including a few possible mock UIs to show different cases (all fields are filled, only required fields are filled etc.). I also implemented the user data table of the local database in accordance with the profile informations.

I am a member of the backend team. My main responsibility was CRUD, get set and test implementations or review of need and resource pages .

##### Main contributions:

I worked on need and resource related files as a backend team member, implemented need CRUD, set and get functions, gave feedback and reviewed the resource endpoint implementations. Also implemented half of the need test files and tested reviewed my team members contributons. Since I am a new member of the team and new to the technologies, I was not very dominant and could not contribute as much as I would liked to the project.

#### Member: Can Bora Uğur

##### Responsibilities:

I am a member of the frontend team who entered the team this semester. My responsibilities were to implement the profile page and help with some others, such as authentication pages.

##### Main contributions:

I implemented the majority of the frontend profile page, connected it to backend, and made changes on the login page to properly login (on my end) and redirect to the profile. As there were a lot of new tools and web development concepts that I needed to work on, my contributions weren't as much as I would have wanted.

- **Code-related significant issues**:
  - [Frontend - Profile page design and implementation](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/issues/330)
  - [Frontend - Authentication pages' design and implementation (minor)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/issues/328)
- **Management-related significant issues**:
  - [Reviewing the project details and requirements as a new member](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/issues/263)
  - [Creating labels for subteams](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/issues/294)
- **Pull requests**:

    - [Fixing navbar](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/pull/417)
- **Additional information**: Studied React, NextJS, Tailwind CSS, iron-session, axios and the concepts of session management and middlewares. This took much more time than the actual implementations I've done.

## The Software

[Docker build intructions are provided here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/wiki/Docker-and-local-deployment-tutorial)
-Additionally, backend needs config.py that is not pushed due to security reasons. Required variables can be found in backend/config.example file. config.py file should be created just like the config.example before the build.

For Mobile:
If you have an Android device, you need to connect that device to your computer.
Then you should open the terminal and write:
adb install <address_of_apk>
You can easily drag and drop the file after writing adb install if you want
Then your device will upload the project.
Here is the [apk (under assets named app-debug.apk)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/releases)

If you do not have adb in your device you need to install it first, by following [this link](https://www.minitool.com/news/adb-install-windows-10-mac.html)

For MAC; You need to write this to the terminal:
brew install android-platform-tools

For Windows; Follow the guide the link above

For Linux; You need to write this to the terminal::
